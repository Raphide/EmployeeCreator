## Design Goals / Approach

-   In terms of design I aim to go for something sleek and minimalist.
    - Must be easy/simple to use and intuitive.
    - Must also give user feedback for errors/success

---

## Features

-   This is still unfinished but so far the back end basics are done (Database and REST API functionality is there).
- Front end can GET and display all employees in the database and a form to enter employees has been built but has not been implemented yet.

---

## Known issues

-   MVP is still in progress so there are still bugs/issues present

---

## Future Goals

-   Testing for back end and front end still needs to be implemented
-   Front end still needs styling
